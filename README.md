# Project/Activity: Group Portfolio
> This is a group activity for KodeGo bootcamp. The activity is to make a group portfolio using React.js showcasing the group name, about the group, the team members, the services and other things the team wanted to include.

## Group Name: Brogrammer

> This project is created by Brogrammer. Brogrammer came from the portmanteau of the words "Brother" and "Programmer". Brother in this term does not necessarily only refers to a male but refers to the essence of kinship or brotherhood. Thus a brotherhood of programmers with a united goal of providing the best services for our clients and the best result for our projects.
